# 🌍 Interactive Translation Builder for OpenMRS Form Builder -GSOC'25

An intuitive, in-app translation tool for the OpenMRS Form Builder that empowers non-technical users to create, edit, preview, and export multilingual form translations—without writing JSON or restarting the system.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Currently, translating forms in OpenMRS requires editing configuration files and restarting the system—making it inaccessible to non-developers. This project introduces an **Interactive Translation Builder**, integrated directly into the Form Builder UI, to simplify and streamline the translation process.

## ✨ Features

- 🔤 **Translation Editor Interface**: Side-by-side editing of translatable strings for all supported languages
- 🌐 **Language Management**: Add, remove, and manage multiple languages with ease
- 👀 **Live Preview**: Instantly preview forms in the selected language
- 📁 **Export Support**: Generate properly formatted JSON files for OpenMRS Initializer
- 🧩 **No Backend Changes**: Built entirely on the existing form engine

## 📦 Deliverables

- ✅ UI for managing translations inside the Form Builder
- ✅ Responsive language switcher and real-time preview
- ✅ Export feature to generate Initializer-compatible translation files
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation for users and developers

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- React (OpenMRS Form Builder)
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS (optional for styling)
- i18next (or similar library for translation handling)
